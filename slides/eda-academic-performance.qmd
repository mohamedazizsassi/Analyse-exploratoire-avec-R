## 1) Title

- **Title:** Exploratory Data Analysis of Academic Performance
- **Focus:** Mathematics vs Portuguese (two independent student cohorts)
- **Scope:** Descriptive EDA only (no prediction, no causality)

**Key message:** This talk summarizes exploratory insights on final grades (G3) across two subjects.

## 2) Context & Motivation

- Academic performance is multidimensional (school context, behaviors, support, study habits)
- EDA helps:
  - understand distributions and heterogeneity
  - identify potential descriptive associations
  - guide future (careful) analyses

**Key message:** EDA provides a structured “map” of the data before any modeling decisions.

## 3) Dataset Description

- Source: **Cortez & Silva (2008)** student performance dataset
- Two datasets (independent):
  - Mathematics: **395 students**
  - Portuguese: **649 students**
- Target variable: **Final grade G3** (0–20)
- Variables: demographics, family context, study habits, behaviors, school support

**Key message:** Two separate cohorts allow comparisons by subject, but not within-student changes.

## 4) Methodology (EDA Only)

- Data preparation:
  - recoding categorical variables, creating descriptive indices (e.g., alcohol index)
- Descriptive statistics:
  - means/medians, dispersion, pass rates
- Exploratory association tools:
  - histograms/boxplots/scatterplots
  - **Spearman** correlations (robust to non-normality / ordinal variables)
- Multivariate overview:
  - **PCA** on standardized numeric variables

**Key message:** All results are descriptive; no predictive modeling and no causal claims.

## 5) Exploratory Hypotheses (Guiding Questions)

- **H1:** G3 distributions differ between Mathematics and Portuguese
- **H2:** Higher absences are descriptively associated with lower G3
- **H3:** Behavioral variables (e.g., alcohol, going out) show descriptive associations with G3
- **H4:** Associations may differ across context (school) and/or sex

**Key message:** Hypotheses are used as a reading grid, not as confirmatory tests.

## 6) Demographic Profile (Age & Sex)

- Age is concentrated around mid-teen values (typical secondary school range)
- Sex distribution is broadly comparable across subjects, but differs by cohort

![](../docs/qmd/student-performance-eda_files/figure-html/fig-age-1.png)

**Key message:** Demographics provide essential context for interpreting grade differences.

## 7) Distribution of Final Grades (G3)

- Compare shape, spread, and central tendency of G3 by subject
- Look for skewness, ceiling effects, and variability differences

![](../docs/qmd/student-performance-eda_files/figure-html/fig-g3-dist-1.png)

**Key message:** Portuguese shows a higher central tendency and lower dispersion than Mathematics.

## 8) Quantitative Comparison (Math vs Portuguese)

- Summary (G3):

| Subject | n | Mean G3 | Median G3 | Pass rate (G3≥10) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Mathematics | 395 | 10.42 | 11 | 67.1% |
| Portuguese | 649 | 11.91 | 12 | 84.6% |

- Differences (Mathematics − Portuguese):
  - Mean difference: **-1.49**
  - Median difference: **-1**
  - Effect size (Cohen’s d): **≈ -0.39**

**Key message:** The average Portuguese G3 is higher; the standardized difference is small-to-moderate.

## 9) Variables Most Associated with G3 (Spearman)

- Correlation matrix overview:

![](../docs/qmd/student-performance-eda_files/figure-html/fig-corr-1.png)

- Top descriptive associations with G3 (Spearman, approximate):

| Variable | Spearman rho with G3 |
|---|---:|
| failures | -0.41 |
| parent_edu | +0.24 |
| alcohol_index | -0.17 |
| absences | -0.11 |

- Interpretation (descriptive):
  - Negative rho → higher values tend to coincide with lower G3
  - Positive rho → higher values tend to coincide with higher G3

**Key message:** Prior failures and parental education show strong descriptive links with final grades.

## 10) Focus Example: Alcohol vs Performance

- Exploratory question: does alcohol consumption co-vary with G3?
- Use a simple scatter + smooth trend (no causal interpretation)

![](../docs/qmd/student-performance-eda_files/figure-html/fig-alcohol-g3-1.png)

**Key message:** The alcohol–G3 relationship is weak-to-moderate and should be read as descriptive only.

## 11) Additional Descriptive Focus: Weekday Alcohol & Absences

- **Weekday alcohol consumption (Dalc)** is ordinal (1–5) and differs in distribution across cohorts
- **Study time vs absences** helps describe how engagement and attendance co-vary (still descriptive)

![](../docs/qmd/student-performance-eda_files/figure-html/fig-dalc-weekday-1.png)

![](../docs/qmd/student-performance-eda_files/figure-html/fig-absences-by-studytime-1.png)

**Key message:** Attendance patterns and weekday alcohol levels provide concrete descriptive contrasts between subjects.

## 12) Discussion & Methodological Limitations

- Two **independent cohorts** (Math vs Portuguese): comparisons are between groups
- Many variables are ordinal; numeric conversions are for exploration only
- Correlations and trends:
  - can be sensitive to confounding and non-linearities
  - should not be interpreted as causal effects
- Multiple comparisons: treat p-values (if shown) as exploratory

**Key message:** The analysis highlights patterns, but does not establish causes.

## 13) Conclusion & Key Takeaways

- Portuguese shows higher G3 central tendency and pass rate than Mathematics
- Strongest descriptive associations with G3 include:
  - prior failures (negative)
  - parental education (positive)
  - some behavioral indicators (weak-to-moderate)
- Results remain consistent with EDA scope (no modeling, no causality)

**Key message:** Differences across subjects exist and are interpretable at a descriptive level.

## 14) Perspectives (Future Exploratory Work)

- Stratified EDA:
  - by school and sex to assess heterogeneity
- Robustness checks:
  - compare Spearman vs Kendall
  - sensitivity to outliers (winsorization)
- Missing data:
  - patterns, potential bias in descriptive summaries
- Optional (still non-ML): richer descriptive visualizations (interaction plots, small multiples)

**Key message:** Next steps can deepen the descriptive story without moving into prediction or causality.
